# Autonomus-Robo-Car
Tech Turner'sðŸ¤– ( AUTONOMOUS ROBO CAR )

We have made an obstacle avoiding car robot using Arduino Uno. This car robot detects the obstacle and avoids it by changing its direction.



3-D ultrasonic sensors were used to detect the obstacle. Motor driver (L298N)



Tower Pro SG 90 Servo Motor  and B.O gear motors were some of the major tools used.



The robot is fully independent and after initial loading of the code, it does not require user intervention during its operation. When placed in an unfamiliar area with obstacles, it moved while avoiding all obstacles with great precision.



And the cherry on the top was that we used HC05 module to connect our car with a mobile app .The car can be controlled both manually and automatically just by one click in the app.

Hope you all liked our project :) 

Stay tuned for more 

We be coming with more productive projects like this
